				<h2>Coding With HTML</h2>
				<p>
					Hyper Text Markup Language or HTML is the standard for creating websites, 
					but since HTML is limited when it comes to controling the visual aspect and 
					interactiveness of a website it is used in conjuction with 
					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Cascading Style Sheets or (CSS) describes how the emlements in a HTML document 
					is ment to look like. CSS can be written in the HTML document but this time 
					consuming as you will be required to the CSS into each individual tag of the 
					HTML elements. It is more efficent to use an external CSS file that is referenced 
					in the HTML document, with use of <i>Classes</i> and <i>Divisions</i> the control 
					of the CSS can be fine tuned and used across multipule pages with ease.

				<h3>
					Understanding HTML Tags:
				</h3>
				<p>
					HTML uses tags determine functions and control the website. Tags always have to
					be closed once they have been opened as errors will occur due to the browser not
					understanding where the tag ends.
					<br>
				</p>
				<p class="contspace">
					Tag Example: '< tag >'
					<br>
					Closed Tag Example: '< /tag >'
